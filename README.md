## Gameplay Rules

- **Objective:** Complete all main quests and as many side quests as possible to finish Ucup's adventure across the archipelago.
- **Status System:** Players must maintain four primary stats: Hunger, Sleep, Happiness, and Cleanliness. If any of these reach zero, the character will faint and the game will be over.
- **Exploration:** Move Ucup across the islands using keyboard controls (WASD or arrow keys). Discover new locations, hidden secrets, and interactable zones.
- **NPC Interaction & Quests:** Speak with various NPCs to receive quests. Quests may require collecting items, solving puzzles, participating in minigames, or exploring new areas.
- **Minigames:** Engage in diverse minigames such as fishing, coconut harvesting, rock mining, and more. Each minigame has unique mechanics, rules, and rewards:

  - **Coconut Minigame:** Catch falling coconuts within a limited time, avoiding obstacles and maximizing score.
  - **Rock Mining:** Break rocks by timing your swings; durability and stamina impact efficiency.
